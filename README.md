# MemoryCardGame 
Memory Card Game is designed for entertaining, spending the time training your memory and relaxing online, one of the simpliest games which fits both children and adults. The rules are very simple. You can see cards with hidden pictures, and the goal is to find the matching pair as quicly as possible. You can open only two cards at once. If the pair matches, there is additional attempt, if no, another person may try his/ her chance. Also you may play with yourself only, as this simple yet effective game traines your memory and develops attention to details.

Creating this game I used HTML, CSS and Java Script.

## Features

- The game allowes to open only two cardst at the time, others are blocked.
- If two cards match, they stay flipped till all other cards will be opened, if cards dont match, after 15sec they automatically flip again in the same position, so another move is possible. 
- Ever singe game cards shuffle, so each time its a new game with random position of cards.
- It`s very easy to start a new game, just refreshing a browser.


## Features Left to Implement. 

- Adding some scoring system;
- Adding timing and measurements how quickly the player can finish the game.
- More advanced levels with a greater amount of cards, so the game will be more challenging.

## Challenges 
  
  Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:

1. Learning a lot of coding from JavaScript, not everything was successfull. 
  
2. Tried to clean and reduce the code. 
 
3. Still need to understand how to use JavaScript commands to be able to reach desirable effect. 
  
  
 
  ## Testing
  
 - Testing the game in different brovsers: Google, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge. 
  
 - Tried use different approaches and solutions. 
  
 - Tried to do other projects simultanuously, decided to share with this one. 
  
 - My results from PageSpeed Insights:
